    <p id="guide-p">It is best to have your hearing done in person, rather than online or by mail. You will be able to more easily state your case and have a discussion with the officer.
         Be sure to be mannerly and respectful during the hearing.
        
        
        
    </p>
    <p id="guide-p">Be sure to address the judge as “Your honor” or “sir/ma’am.”</p>
    <p id="guide-p">Bring any evidence you might have, be it receipts, pictures, or any other document that might help your case.</p>
    <p id="guide-p">Never admit that you were parked illegally, and never try to use sympathy to get the ticket appealed.</p>
    <p id="guide-p">Be sure to use the Municipal Code, which can be found on their website but here are the time constraints that you have:</p>

    <ul id="guide-ul">
        <li><i>You have twenty-one (21) days from the Notice of Violation date to contest the issuance of an automated traffic law enforcement (i.e. red light) or automated speed camera enforcement violation.</i></li>
        <li><i>You have seven (7) days from the date of issuance of a parking or compliance violation to contest the ticket. If neither a contest or payment is received, a second Notice of Violation is mailed allowing twenty-one (21) days to request a hearing.</i></li>
        <li><i>If no response to the Notice of Violation is received, a Notice of Determination is mailed as notification that you have been found liable by default and have the option to petition to set aside the default judgment by appearing in person within twenty-one (21) days of the date of the Determination. Once the twenty-one (21) days have lapsed, your opportunity to contest has expired. After twenty-five (25) days a Notice of Final Determination is mailed informing you that your options to challenge the ticket, both administratively and judicially, have been forfeited. A penalty equal to the amount of the fine will be assessed at that time.</i></li>
    </ul>
    <p id="guide-p">Be sure to look at what defenses are allowed, as they are different depending on your case and type of ticket.</p>
