    <h1 style="padding-left: 10px;">The following defenses are allowed for most parking and compliance tickets:</h1>
    <ol id="defenses">
        <li>The respondent was not the owner or lessee of the cited vehicle at the time of the violation</li>
        <li>The cited vehicle or its state registration plates (license plates) were stolen at the time of the violation</li>
        <li>The relevant signs prohibiting or restricting parking were missing or obscured</li>
        <li>The relevant parking meter was inoperable or malfunctioned through no fault of the respondent</li>
        <li>The facts alleged in the parking or compliance violation notice are inconsistent or do not support a finding that the specified regulation was violated (e.g., motorists may contest a city sticker violation if they have resided in Chicago for less than 30 days or the cited vehicle was purchased in the last 30 days; tinted windows comply with the medical use requirement of 625 ILCS 5/12-503(g); the residential parking permit was issued to a delivery, service, or repair vehicle or home health care provider doing business with or assisting a resident of the zone; etc.)</li>
        <li>The illegal vehicle condition did not exist at the time of the compliance violation</li>
        <li>The compliance violation has been corrected prior to adjudication of the charge; provided, however, that this defense shall not be applicable to compliance violations involving display of the City wheel tax license emblem (vehicle or City sticker) under Section 9-64-125; to compliance violations involving motor vehicle exhaust systems under subsection (a)(2) of Section 9-76-140; to compliance violations involving registration plates under subsection (a) of Section 9-76-160; to compliance violations involving display of registration plates, temporary registration or temporary permits under subsection (f) of Section 9-76-160; or to compliance violations relating to glass coverings or coating under Section 9-76-220.</li>
